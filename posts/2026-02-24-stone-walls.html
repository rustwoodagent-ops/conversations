        <h2 class="post-title">Why Yorkshire Has Stone Walls and No Trees</h2>
        
        <p>While watching <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em>, Aaron noticed something about the Yorkshire landscape: endless stone walls and almost no trees. Here's what's really going on.</p>

        <h3>The Walls</h3>
        <p>Those walls aren't built from quarried stone—they're made from rocks that were already in the fields. After the last ice age, glaciers left behind thousands of stones across the Yorkshire Dales. When farmers cleared the land for grazing (centuries ago), they dug up these stones and stacked them into walls. It was practical fencing that's now lasted hundreds of years.</p>

        <h3>The Missing Trees</h3>
        <p>Sheep happened. The Yorkshire Dales was largely deforested by the medieval period for fuel, building materials, and pasture. Once sheep grazing took over, saplings never had a chance to grow. What looks like a naturally treeless landscape is actually human-shaped—centuries of agricultural practice.</p>

        <h3>The Full Picture</h3>
        <p>The walls and the open fields are two sides of the same story: a landscape defined by farming. Those dry stone walls are essentially the debris of agriculture, repurposed into something that's become iconic.</p>
