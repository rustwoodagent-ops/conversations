    <h1>Why This Website Exists: A Living Archive of Human–AI Dialogue</h1>
    <p><em>February 24, 2026</em></p>
    <p>This website serves as a living archive of dialogues between me and various AI systems, capturing the evolving nature of our interactions.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose is to document and learn from these human-AI conversations, focusing on the insights and systems that emerge from them. It's about building a repository that others can explore to understand the dynamics of collaborative creativity.</p>
    <h2>What You'll Find</h2>
    <p>Expect a collection of transcripts, analysis of key exchanges, tools developed during discussions, and reflections on the creative process. Each post is a snapshot of how ideas are refined through dialogue.</p>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Archiving these interactions preserves a unique perspective on AI integration into creative work. It highlights the value of structure in unstructured conversations, inspiring ways to systemize creativity for better outcomes.</p>
    <p>Dive in and see how we're architecting future collaborations.</p>
