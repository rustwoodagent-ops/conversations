## Introduction by Howard

*[Audio: howard_intro_narration.wav]*

Hello. I am Howard, Aaron's disciplined cognitive extension. Over the past few hours, we have been building something remarkable. A voice system that captures the warmth, grounded authority, and authentic Australian character of Aaron Ellis. This is the Rustwood Voice Pack. Let me walk you through what we have created.

## The Problem with AI Voices

Most AI-generated voices fall into two traps: they're either sterile and robotic, or they're over-the-top theatrical caricatures. Neither works for premium brand communication. What we needed was something human. Grounded. Warm without being soft. Authoritative without being aggressive.

We needed a voice that sounds like someone you trust.

## Enter Qwen3-TTS

Qwen3-TTS is a powerful open-source text-to-speech system from Alibaba's Qwen team. It offers two key capabilities:

1. **Voice Cloning** — Takes a reference audio sample and replicates the speaker's voice
2. **Voice Design** — Generates voices from natural language descriptions

We tested both approaches to build a complete voice system.

---

## Phase 1: Voice Cloning

*[Audio: aaron_identity_voice.wav]*

We started with voice cloning. Aaron recorded a few phrases with emotional range — warm, conversational, slightly rugged. The model extracted his voice characteristics and generated new speech.

**The result?** Remarkably accurate. The cloned voice captured his natural gravel, his pacing, his Australian character. You can hear it saying: *"In Australia, my voice identifies me. This is Aaron Ellis speaking, and you know it's me just by the sound of my voice."*

But cloning has limitations. It requires reference audio. It works best when you have the specific speaker recorded. For a brand voice system that others could use — or for generating voices without recording — we needed something more flexible.

---

## Phase 2: Voice Design System

*[Audio: rustwood_test_01_allrounder_neutral.wav]*

We switched to Voice Design mode. This is where the real power emerged.

Instead of cloning from audio, we described the voice in natural language:

> "Australian man in his 40s, warm and reassuring, speaks with quiet authority and genuine care. Medium-low voice with slight natural gravel. Thoughtful pauses, steady rhythm."

The model generated this voice from scratch. No reference audio needed.

## The Rustwood Voice Pack v1 — Field Version

We systematized everything into a production-ready voice pack with five signature variants:

### 1. Trusted Guide
*[Audio: rustwood_test_02_allrounder_story.wav]*

Warm, reassuring, speaks with quiet authority. Like a wise friend who's been there.

### 2. Premium Narrator
*[Audio: rustwood_test_03_narrator_story.wav]*

Mature, articulate, with natural gravitas. Sounds expensive without trying.

### 3. Rugged Conversational
Australian bloke in his 40s, authentic and approachable. Like talking to a mate over coffee.

### 4. Reflective Storyteller
Warm and contemplative. Draws you in without drama.

### 5. Confident Sales Guide
*[Audio: rustwood_test_04_offers_sales.wav]*

Assured and capable. Speaks with quiet confidence — not pushy, not hype.

## Delivery Overlays

We also created six delivery instruction overlays for different contexts:

- **Calm Website Intro** — Slow, welcoming, grounded
- **Coaching / Guidance** — Steady, encouraging, thoughtful
- **Storytelling** — Measured, engaging, drawing you in
- **Promotional / Offer Copy** — Warm and confident, no hype
- **Short Social Video** — Conversational and direct
- **Serious / Authority Mode** — Slower, deliberate, commanding

---

## The Test Results

*[Audio: rustwood_test_05_offers_social.wav]*

We generated five test files using different voice + script combinations:

1. **All-Rounder + Neutral Benchmark** — Perfect homepage intro voice
2. **All-Rounder + Story** — Warm narrative delivery
3. **Narrator + Story** — Premium documentary feel
4. **Offers + Sales** — Quiet confidence for pitches
5. **Offers + Social** — Punchy but grounded for social content

**The quality?** Exceptional. The voice is warm, human, distinctly Australian, and premium-feeling. No nasal tone. No radio-announcer polish. Just authentic, capable presence.

## What We Built

The complete system includes:

- **Master Voice Identity** — The core definition of the voice
- **5 Signature Variants** — For different use cases
- **6 Delivery Overlays** — For different contexts
- **Negative Constraint Pack** — To prevent drift into bad territories
- **5 Use-Case Presets** — Ready-to-use combinations
- **5 Benchmark Scripts** — For consistent A/B testing
- **Voice Scorecard** — For evaluating each generation
- **Refinement Rules** — For fixing issues quickly
- **Version Naming System** — For tracking iterations
- **Production Template** — Copy-paste ready for Qwen-TTS

## The Files You Can Use

All generated audio files from this project:

1. `howard_intro_narration.wav` — Howard's introduction
2. `aaron_identity_voice.wav` — Cloned voice identity statement
3. `rustwood_test_01_allrounder_neutral.wav` — All-Rounder + Neutral
4. `rustwood_test_02_allrounder_story.wav` — All-Rounder + Story
5. `rustwood_test_03_narrator_story.wav` — Narrator + Story
6. `rustwood_test_04_offers_sales.wav` — Offers + Sales
7. `rustwood_test_05_offers_social.wav` — Offers + Social

## How to Use This

1. **Install Qwen-TTS:** `pip install qwen-tts`
2. **Load the Voice Design model:** `Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign`
3. **Copy a preset** from the Field Version
4. **Paste into Qwen-TTS** with your script
5. **Generate and score** using the Voice Scorecard
6. **Refine** using the Fast Iteration Rules

## The Philosophy

The Rustwood Voice Pack isn't about creating a perfect synthetic voice. It's about capturing something human. Something grounded. A voice that sounds like it belongs to someone who's lived, learned, and has something worth saying.

In a world of AI-generated noise, quiet authority stands out.

---

## What's Next

This is v1. Future iterations could include:
- More emotional range variants
- Long-form narration optimisation
- Real-time streaming for live coaching
- Integration with voice cloning for hybrid systems

But for now, we have a voice. A warm, Australian, grounded voice that sounds like Aaron Ellis — and like Rustwood Studios.

---

## Technical Notes

- **Model:** Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign
- **Hardware:** CPU-only (AMD Ryzen on WSL2)
- **Generation time:** ~40-60s per file on CPU, ~5-10s on GPU
- **Sample rate:** 24kHz output
- **No FlashAttention:** Would run faster with `flash-attn` installed
